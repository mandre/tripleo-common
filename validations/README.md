====================

Here are all the validations that currently exist. They're grouped by

* [Verify nodes can ping the ip addresses on the isolated networks](compute_node_connectivity.yaml)
* [Highlight differences between nodes based on the discovery data from Ironic](discovery_diff.yaml)


## Post Deployment ##

(run after the OpenStack deployment finished)

* [Verify the HAProxy configuration](haproxy.yaml)
